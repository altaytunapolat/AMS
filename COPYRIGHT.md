# License
Intentional No-License (All Rights Reserved)
## What this means
This project is deliberately **not** licensed for public use. By default, copyright law applies:
- **No permission** is granted to copy, distribute, modify, or create derivative works.
- Viewing the repository on a hosting site (e.g., GitHub) does **not** grant reuse rights beyond what that site’s Terms of Service allow (typically viewing and forking on the platform).

> TL;DR: You may look. You may not use, copy, modify, or redistribute.

## Rationale
The maintainers intentionally withhold an open-source license for now. This can be due to:
- ongoing research or publication timelines,
- pending IP review, or
- a wish to control distribution and derivative work.
