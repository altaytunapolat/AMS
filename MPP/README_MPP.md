**Multi-Purpose Platine (MPP) — AMS Configuration Overview**

* **Purpose:** Precise acquisition of magnetic field signals for Active Magnetic Shielding.
* **Sensors → ADC:** Sensor outputs are digitized via an **ADS1115** converter.
* **Output:** Clean, time-stamped data for monitoring, control loops, and logging.
* **Context:** Built for the PAT/HEXE group (Heidelberg); reusable across lab setups.
